## Problem Description

For this class, we are planning on making an online bookstore where users can browse, search and purchase books. 

First, to create different types of book objects on user preferences, like fiction, horror, etc., we are going to apply the Factory Method pattern.

Second, to implement different payment methods, we are going to apply the Strategy pattern.

Lastly, to notify users about new book arrivals or promotions, we are going to apply the Observer pattern.

### Requirements 

The requirements will be determined, by the usage of the MoSCoW-method. With the usage
of the MoSCoW-method, the group is able to analyse and prioritize the functions in the according manner.

#### Must Have:

The first would be the **Must-Have's**, these are necessary to the product itself, in order to properly make it functional. 

#### Should Have:

The second would be **Should-Have's**, these aren't necessary to the product but still hold some importance.
The main focus being, that they **Should** have been in the product, but aren't essential to make the product work.

#### Could Have:

The third would be **Could-Have's**, these aren't necessary nor essential. They would be nice to have, in the product as an extra.

#### Won't Have:

The fourth would be **Won`t-Have's**, these as the name suggests will not be in the product at all.
